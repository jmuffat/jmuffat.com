In 2006, I was so inspired by this talk that I totally rearchitected the photo
library manager I had just started, to get ready for the 'multitouch' revolution
that this was announcing.

Today, I watched this video again, I hadn't in years. And you know what ?
Fourteen long years later, I feel that, as an industry, we really are extremely
far from having even started to fulfill the promises of this talk !!!
