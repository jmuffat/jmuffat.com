Born in the most beautiful city in the World, [Antibes](https://www.antibesjuanlespins.com/), in the days of the General de Gaulle, my teenage years saw the most fantastic inventions: Rubik's cube, windsurfing, arcade games, D&D, programmable calculators, the PC... Being a geek wasn't a social status to boast about yet !

I have been the lucky owner of a (genuine) [IBMpc](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_PH02.html)
extremely early, as my father who was working for IBM swiftly replaced the turbocharged [ZX81](http://www.le-grenier-informatique.fr/pages/la-collextion/sinclair-zx81.html)
I had been using until then. I guess I can claim I have been coding everyday ever since I crossed
paths with a TI-57, quite a long time ago now. I was always looking for a challenge, in the 80's I was
rendering furniture in 3D using an Hercules card, I experimented with digital photography
on [Canon iON](http://www.collection-appareils.fr/x/html/appareil-10562-Canon_Ion%20RC%20250.html) ;
in the 90's, I left the French Riviera for Paris where I found many interesting projects
like writing a visual train circulation planning tool for the SNCF.

An then, 1994, I join the absolutely bonkers people at [HaïKu Studios](https://web.archive.org/web/19961225045749/http://www.haikustudios.com/)... Writing videogames is the most exciting thing I have done
in my life, whatever anyone in the team does, it is "[turned up to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzLP2Z7JVZA)",
whether it's about technic, creativity or motivation. It was a fascinating period
of time that saw the appearance of the CD-ROM and the first [3D accelerators](http://vintage3d.org/3dlabs.php#sthash.L9aYUoky.dpbs). When HaïKu had to shut down, I followed the part of
the team, including my brother, who had joined [Bits Studios](https://web.archive.org/web/20080331222327/http://www.bitsstudios.com/)
in London, where we spent fabulously rich years with the N64, XBox, PS/2 and the
infancy of online games.


2005, back to France, in parallel with contracting work, I started revisiting
photo cataloguing, with the view of accelerating all operations as if they were
part of a game. While in the process of putting together a concept around [pan+zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2uSv_inwcU),
I heard that Intel was finally joining the GPU race, boldly architecting it
on an x86 foundation. The Larrabee adventure was a fascinating one, even if it only
lasted for a short time. I went back to my futuristic photo library concept,
inside Intel this time, where it became a bit like a concept-car, letting us
evaluate performances in a forward looking context. Technologies keep evolving
and, over and again, everything is to be invented !

But I'm not just a geek, I've also been known as a keen epicurean, with a soft
spot for restaurants, bakeries, delicatessen and winemongers, all these places
with stories to share, secrets to reveal and good times to be had. I even had
the opportunity to combine geek and foodie when I met [Nicolas Gautier](https://www.restaurant-nature.com/),
with whom we created [Baladovore](http://www.baladovore.com/), and app that
referenced the food producers who chef's get their supply from, so everybody
can easily locate delicious+authentic products from human sized operations.

Also, I can have a tendency to be a bit long winded...
