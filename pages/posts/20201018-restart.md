Like many, I keep starting to put stuff online only to get caught
into something else and letting things drift until some new medium
appears to make me want to start over. So, here we go, this is
my new home online...

What's the new tech this time, then ? I am using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
and hosting using Vercel. I have never felt comfortable with Wordpress and,
even though it can do whatever I might need (and more), I never
feel entirely satisfied. It's a bit like Word, actually, big piece of
software that can do whatever but feels like driving a big truck. What
I really need is a motorcycle.

I have no doubt that there will be a good level of frustration with
this setup too, but at least it will be frustration I created for myself :)
