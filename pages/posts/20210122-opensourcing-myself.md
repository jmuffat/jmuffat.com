I was talking with [François Piednoël](https://twitter.com/FPiednoel) about crazy ideas
we like to share and something came up that should have been totally obvious:
I'm looking for work without anything visible on
my github ! Not very clever for a coder...

I came up with something a bit mad : I am going to start with making the source
of __this site__ public. There are actually a bunch of interesting things to talk
about in there and code snippets that may come useful to others. It is a very
strange feeling to show the internals of one's "home page", it literally feels
like leaving my home's frontdoor open. On one hand it feels awkward but
at the same time it feels absolutely great because there are so many things I
will be able to share. It actually gives meaning to this site.

Before this version of the site, I tried using Wordpress. I was looking for a
way to post things like I would on Facebook but in a way that would make content
less 'disposable'. It didn't go very far mainly out of frustration, everything
seemed like there was some plugin to add, more fields to fill, boxes to check.
In the end nothing much happened on that site as it really ended up being just
additional steps before posting to Facebook. There was no point.

One day I started playing with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and grew quite
a liking for it. It does what I want: let me code pages using
[React](https://reactjs.org/), produces content that is ready to be indexed by
spiders and feels much quicker to load than what I had written before
using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is how I started to write this personal site and am now really happy with
what I can do with it. It's simple where it needs to be: posting is a simple
matter of creating a new markdown file and committing it to gihub. It's powerful
where it needs to be: adding a page like my [SVG map generator](/maps) doesn't
require any kind of contorsion.

Buckle up, next posts on this thread are going to become technical !
