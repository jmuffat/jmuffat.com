This repository contains the source code to my home page
at [https://jmuffat.com](https://jmuffat.com). On  22 January 2021, I decided
that I had as much to say through the content of the site as through the code
presenting it.

Code in this repository is not expected to be used outside of my home page. Most
of it is written primarily as experiments. Please get in touch if you're looking
at reusing anything, so I don't abruptly pull the rug under your feet.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is hosted on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) for the content with larger data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
