We all have so many photos... Around 2005, I had the idea of applying videogames
techniques to photo cataloging software and started a project I called
[gpuViewer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2uSv_inwcU). My main idea was to
leverage the Pan&Zoom concept that was emerging together with multitouch.

When I joined Intel in 2008, the company bought the IP and the project became
part of my work. It got renamed
[deepViewer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3WrdDy_Dg), the focus on gpu
wasn't too popular internally :) . We used it a bit like a concept car,
as a forward looking workload and demonstrating the [level of interactivity
that could be achieved on Atom
tablets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFVH9egfPcA) amongst other things.

In 2020, I was part of a round of redundancies. Intel gave me permission to
keep creating derivative works of the concept and, putting confinement time to
good use, I've been bringing pan+zoom to iPhone/iPad's photo library.
