First thing this year, I was happy to post about an idea about using
[std::unique_ptr as a wrapper](/posts/20250102-ultimate-wrapper) for
libCurl easy handles. I was happy about the simplicity and I was also 
happy because copilot guessed what I was going to type when I started, 
which I took as confirmation this was something people do (how might 
that little parrot guess, otherwise?). It turns out that it does not 
even compile, since `CURL*` really is a `void*` and my wrapper 
translates to a `unique_ptr<void,...>`... Shame. So, ok, never mind, I 
went back to writing a wrapper myself, constructor, destructor, 
rule-of-five, nothing special.

At this point, I expect that those still reading are wondering:
_"what took you so long ? Why didn't you realise straight away
that it didn't even compile ?"_. Well, I was in a tunnel. I was
reworking my code to fetch a url so that it'd use coroutines and
could be presented like `Fetch` in Javascript. I'm out of this
tunnel now and it lets me write things this way:

```cpp
    auto res = co_await fetcher.fetch("https://httpbin.org/get");
    auto mimetype = res.getHeader("content-type");
    auto len = res.getHeader("content-length");

    auto json = co_await res.json();
    auto headers = json["headers"].GetObject();
    auto agent = headers["User-Agent"].GetString();
```

The need for a wrapper came when I split the logic in two parts,
so as to be able to get the headers and, once we have them, 
decide what to do with the contents. This means chaining 
coroutines and passing the CURL handle from one to the other as
we progress... or dispose of the handle if anything unexpected 
happens. The initial code was using a plain `CURL*` as its lifetime
was straightforward ; with many more cases to take into 
account, I tend to prefer to rely on something akin to a
`unique_ptr` to avoid leaving any leaks...

Now, I'm asking myself what led me to publish that first post
even though I hadn't tried it yet. This is the reason for my choosing
a maze as the illustration for today's post: there are two sorts of
mazes, those that are a single path wrapped around itself and those
that are like a tree and you want to reach a specific leaf... I
think we tend to solve the latter as if they were the former and 
backtrack when we reach dead ends. That's really what happened here: 
I thought this was a clean and elegant solution and the rest would 
just be legwork. I assumed there was nothing left to solve and as 
always (as they say in "Under Siege II"):
