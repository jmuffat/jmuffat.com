title: using Markdown as Next.js pages

In [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages), each page in your
website is represented by a javascript file that serves as its
entry point. These pages get pre-rendered at build time, or on the server side
if they're dynamic, which has the advantage of being easier to index by spiders
and also to be immediately ready to display on the client as no startup code
needs to run before things appear.

This is great but, of course, I don't want to write my posts in javascript!
I write posts in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
as it is a great compromise between being readable and providing rich encoding.

What I ended up doing was to write a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) plugin
that lets me use my markdown content in place of the usual javascript files. The
plugin simply takes a `.md` file as input and generates javascript that next.js
can then compile like it expects to. In the end, it simply is a matter of
modifying  `next.config.js` to handle the conversion:

~~~js
config.module.rules.push({
  test: /\.md$/,
  include: pagesFolder,
  use: [
    ...loaders,
    {
      loader:path.resolve('lib/post-loader.js'),
      options:{}
    }
  ]
})
~~~

 - `pagesFolder` is the path to the `/pages` folder that next.js uses to build
 the tree structure ; markdown present elsewhere should be left alone
 - `loaders` is the set of plugins already registered to process javascript, I
 should be able to make this implicit but haven't figured it out yet (any advice
   would be welcome)


The code in `lib/post-loader.js` then, given the Markdown content, inserts it
into code like this :

~~~js
import PostPage from '@/components/post'
import {getPostThread} from '@/lib/compile-posts'
<<<importSupportScript(md)>>>

const Page = (props)=> (
  <PostPage
    slug={<<<slug>>>}
    content={props.content}
    script={MDScript}
    threadPosts={props.threadPosts}
    ${coverSize(md)}
  />
)

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      content: <<<escapedSource>>>,
      threadPosts: getPostThread('posts',<<<thread>>>,['slug', 'title', 'date'])
    },
  }
}

export default Page
~~~

 - `escapedSource` is the markdown content with back quotes escaped so it's safe
 to include in source code
  - `slug` is the name of the markdown file
  - `thread` is the thread name if there is one in the front matter of the post
  - `coverSize(md)` fetches the size of the cover image if there is one in the
  front matter
  - `importSupportScript(md)` lets me import more code (as `MDScript`) for pages that include
  special features, but I'll talk more about this in a future post.


In a previous version of this post, I was saying that writing this blog works great as
a code review. I was even more right than I expected as it made me realize I had
a wrong vision of `getStaticProps`. I was looking at generating everything in my
plugin to make the generated code simpler, which worked, but it wasn't the best
strategy as I realized when working on translations...

To see this in context, you can check out the code on [gitHub](https://github.com/jmuffat/jmuffat.com) !

In future posts I'll talk about implementing i18n (Internationalization) which
I have almost finished and, as promised above, I'll talk about how [posts with special features](/posts/20210119-mapdev)
are put together.
