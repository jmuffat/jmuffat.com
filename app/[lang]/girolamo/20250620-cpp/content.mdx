A friend, asking me what I was up to these days, was surprised that I'd use C++
to start a new project. We've written a lot of C++ together, going back to 
the end of 80s. So this made me realise it wasn't as obvious as I might have
thought, hence this post. 

# vs CSharp
His main thing was _"why don't you use something like C# and be rid of 
managing memory ?"_. I don't feel I'm having any problems managing memory in 
C++. For ages, constructors, destructors and scopes have been my main tool 
to ensure resources (not just memory) get tracked properly. Also `std::unique_ptr` 
and `std::shared_ptr` are here to keep the more involved situations under 
control. As a matter of fact, the idea that I know precisely and for sure 
when resources get disposed of is one of my main reasons for liking C++.

# vs Javascript
This may sound as an odd point to bring up, here's why: if you want to write
code that will run on pretty much any platform, target web browsers. So, of
course, I considered it: there is no reason I couldn't replicate most of what
I had written over ten years ago, on today's machines, in a browser. I actually
did experiment. I ran into two main problems: UI/DOM and sandboxing. Running
inside the browser means a lot of your UI is decided by the browser, you have
to relinguish control over things like the right-mouse button (workarounds are
possible but tricky). The sandboxing, though, is the dealbreaker: you cannot
access the machine from a web page, this is a problem when your goal is to 
index the user's content. The sandboxing is an _absolute necessity_ in a 
browser, so JS is just out of the question. (... sigh of relief)

# vs Java, Rust, Go, Swift or otherwise
For Javascript, there is the argument of the ubiquity of the browser. For other
languages, so far, there isn't an argument or feature that'd make _me_ want to go further
than experimenting.

# Innovative UI
I strongly believe that applications would benefit from building UI's like
we do in videogames. I am going to dive again in a pan&zoom UI, a very 
dynamic and reactive experience. The easiest way to do this is to go
down to the graphics API and handle resources at that lower level. The
Windows version runs on Vulkan, the OSX version on Metal ; I have built a
version on the Raspberry Pi with Vulkan, so Linux should be covered too. 
That's a great advantage of C++ : it runs on pretty much anything.

# Libraries have C interfaces
There are a few libraries that make a project like **Girolamo** possible, 
handling basic needs. They are all written in C++ or C, they're all trivial
to integrate in a C project:
 - [_libuv_](https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/): the lib that makes node.js asynchronous
 - [_sqlite_](https://sqlite.org): easiest way to store large amounts of structured data inside one file 
 - [_libcurl_](https://curl.se/libcurl/): access (that works) to internet resources 
 - [_opencv_](https://opencv.org): everything computer vision
 - [_llama.cpp_](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp): I don't need to introduce this, do I ?
 - ...

I am going to talk more about all the tools I use in later posts similar to this 
one, but the point is clear: C++ has all the toys !

# Conclusion
I have been away from C++ for a long time because it wasn't a good option to 
build for the new platforms of the time: iOS and Android. I have tried many things
and, I must admit, I missed C++. The best reason I can give for choosing C++ as
the tool of choice for **Girolamo** is this: _I enjoy it_.
